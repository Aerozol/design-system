1. #### Logo

    Use logo sizes consistently across projects.
    For instance, *Brainz logo mini is used as the top left logo across all MB database project pages.
    When unsure, align with other projects.
    Although the icons should never be smaller than the minimum sizes, you may increase sizes as you wish.
    *a specific logo may display fine at a smaller size, but other project logos have more detail, and won’t. Smaller sizes make consistent logo display across projects difficult and are to be avoided. However there may be fringe cases where using smaller sizes is appropriate.
    
    * An area of clear space must be maintained around all sides to preserve the integrity of the logo. This separation from other elements optimises     visibility and recognition. Clear space on all sides of the logo is one ‘half honeycomb’.

    * Don’t stretch the logo. Don’t alter the logo or add effects such as drop shadows,
      embossing, etc. Don’t change the logo opacity. Don’t use the logo on a busy or colorful background.

2. #### Colours

    MetaBrainz sub-brands each have their own colour, which is combined with the Metabrainz orange (right).
    The PANTONE colour system is a way of matching print inks to a colour as closely as possible. Please use the digital colour for digital applications, the PANTONE swatch only applies to physical print items.
    MetaBrainz does not use full black.
    This includes for web use, for instance all headers and body text should be set to #1e1e1e.
    A non-full black is easier to read against a white background, including for most visual impairments.
    
    * Colours are to be used sparingly.
      If a sub-brands colour is purple, it doesn’t mean headers should be purple - usually you should use the MB black.
      Let the logo at the top of the page stand out.
      
    * Gradients are to be used sparingly.
      Gradients are appropriate for backgrounds on landing pages and minimal items that are high up in the hierarchy (level of importance on the page).
      It should not be used for elements that contain data/information, beyond a header. It should be used sparingly on data-centric pages, if at all.
      When in doubt, leave it out.
    
3. #### Design Guidance

    * Think about the layout in terms of ‘hierarchy’. (Hierarchy: the order of importance of elements)
      Add emphasis (good location, style, colour, imagery, etc) to elements at the top of the hierarchy.
      De-emphasize elements at the bottom of the hierarchy.
      
    * Less is more: 
      When using design elements - colours, space, graphics - consider how it helps users understand and use data.
      Functionality first, then enhance with visual tools.
      
    * Less clicks = better: 
      MetaBrainz users spend millions of hours entering data- this means that one more click to perform a common task can have a massive time cost.
      Make a users path clear, then get them there quick.

    * Mobile-first? Not always: 
      Assess the audience for a page/site.
      The nature of some MetaBrainz data-entry orientated projects means that users may primarily use a desktop.
      The ultimate aim is to provide every user with a good experience, regardless of their device.
      
4. #### Accessibility

    We aim to be accessible for all users.
    Use your judgement based on the situation, and make your best effort to apply these guidelines.
    Images should always have alt-text, and critical content/information be included as text.
    Alternate Text describes an image for people using screen readers, or who cannot display images for another reason.
    Images should accompany, not replace, important text, otherwise consider repeating the information as text.

    * Font/text size: 
      No smaller than 12-14pt (1-1.2em / 16-19px)
      ‘Small print’ can be reduced down to 9pt

    * Contrast: 
      Use sufficient contrast levels between background and text.
      Use a contrast checker to assess this:
      https://webaim.org/resources/ contrastchecker/
      Your type/background combination should achieve a ratio of 4+ on the checker.
      
    * Contrast 2: 
      Extreme contrast is also to be avoided.
      This is why we use #1e1e1e instead of full black, on pure white.
