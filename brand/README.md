## About

This directory contains MetaBrainz branding elements, such as [fonts](./fonts), [logos](./logos) and [templates](./templates).

For brand guidelines (how to use these elements) please see <a href="../guidelines/design-guidelines.md">design-guidelines.md</a>.

## Attribution

When required, a MetaBrainz project attribution message must appear in the following places:

1. Each "page" that displays data from a MetaBrainz project must include a short piece of text that
states that this page includes data from a MetaBrainz project AND one of the following:
   _A text link that links to the MetaBrainz project (e.g. https://musicbrainz.org )
   _A small logo of the MetaBrainz project
2. An "about us" or "about our product" type page must display a prominent MetaBrainz project logo
and attribution text.

Attribution is required in each format ("page") or platform where the licensor uses our data (e.g. a website, app or     
presentation). How you implement this should be appropriate for your web pages/product. Furthermore, the
attribution, or "pages" where it appears, must not be selectively hidden from users, or from search engines.
When using MetaBrainz logos you must abide by the guidelines linked on this page. If in doubt, please 
[reach out to MetaBrainz](https://metabrainz.org/contact) and ask.
